<h3>Tech stack used -> Next JS, tailwindCSS, supabase</h3>

<h3>Problem's faced while building the application </h3> <br/>
-> The main problem which I faced was for having updates in real time <br/>
-> Even though I implemented the subscription setup still there was no real time update<br/>
-> I solved it by finding out that the realtime replication was not enabled in the supabase and that was the issue<br/>
-> After I toggled it ON, I now can get real time updates across tabs<br/>
